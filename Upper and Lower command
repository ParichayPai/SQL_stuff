SELECT UPPER('Hello World');

SELECT UPPER(title) FROM books;
 
SELECT CONCAT('MY FAVORITE BOOK IS ', UPPER(title)) FROM books;
 
SELECT CONCAT('MY FAVORITE BOOK IS ', LOWER(title)) FROM books;

*--->upper and lower can take only one arguement

select concat(upper(author_fname),' ',lower(author_lname)) as 'Time_pass_names' from books;
